# Current resumable work checkpoint

Updated: 26 October 2026, India time.

## Resume here

Repository: `drkulkarnipg-lang/doctor-at-home`.
Working branch: `fix/reading-print-document-datetime`.
Durable implementation commit: `4725cf4cf700572166d4415445310fcd8638bfe5`.
Base production commit: `8fada37396585ec6f2b62a79b8e2c27ad2563d77`.
This batch IS RELEASED: PR19 merged as 1888c3a310ae4305c972d0d34c8ad710809b366c on 26 October 2026. Production deployment dpl_3vbXZvtF8HazQnNmiTUS29SF9yGT READY; current statuses in MASTER_TASK_REGISTER.md supersede historical preview notes below.

## Completed and saved implementation

1. Pale article action controls with explicit dark text, border, focus and hover colours for heart/coconut-water/skin cards and their Read/Download/Share controls.
2. Payment methods collapsed by default; QR nested and collapsed. UPI app link and ID-copy controls added. Existing fee-linked, local QR generation retained; initial remote QR request removed.
3. Prescription DOB editor retained on screen but excluded from document clones and moved outside the demographic grid. Calculated age stays in the prescription.
4. Compact A4 document clone/print rules and isolated print root for ordinary prescriptions/pathology/radiology/referral/consent. Genuine long content is not truncated or forced into one page.
5. Doctor signature/name/date/time output across clinical documents; radiology identity/date/time fields; certificate issue/verification time; consent signatory fields; Form2 informant/Registrar date/time. Actual examination/death/signing events are not auto-invented. Government original PDFs remain unchanged.

## Verification completed

- All pre-existing 23 test files passed after the restored implementation.
- New `tests/clinical-documents.test.cjs` passed: metadata, India midnight boundary, retained event dates, fresh clone values, print isolation/cleanup, collapsed QR and UPI amount.
- Real html2pdf output was generated from synthetic local fixtures. Read-only PDF metadata inspection showed complete PDF trailers, A4 MediaBox and ONE page each for normal five-row prescription, pathology and radiology.
- Browser download completion events timed out; files were left as unconfirmed downloads by the cloud browser. These diagnostics do NOT establish successful final file handoff on the owner's device. No security control was bypassed, no pending file was delivered, and no actual patient data was used.

## Next unfinished work — do not restart released PR19

PR19 released, all 24 tests passed after final change (27.1s). Real PDF engine verified 42-row Rx two pages, normal fitness and consent one page; prior normal Rx/path/rad one page checks retained. Physical device print/download and broader filled examples remain unverified. Audit E07/E08 requisition choices next, then pending login/device and n8n/provider setup; use MASTER_TASK_REGISTER.md row IDs. No unrelated integration is complete merely because this batch was released.

## Workspace recovery note

Automated workspace cleanup removed the earlier uncommitted local batch. The repository was re-cloned and the known changes restored, then synchronized in commit 4725cf4. Future work must checkpoint remotely after each completed step. Never describe a new clone as restarting the project.

Checkpoint workflow and new test synchronized in remote commit 5d7eba9. PR19 was created as a draft; no production merge.

Verified preview at source 5d7eba9: deployment dpl_6duUuHw858vMgcaLBKc4QysRSCHx READY, https://home-visiting-icu-doctor-pune-iwgcvch5y-drkulkarnipg-lang.vercel.app/ . Preview protection is retained. Main remains unchanged.

## Online consultation notice — 26 October 2026
Implemented D02/D03: hero tag links to an English/Marathi ₹500 consultation notice beside home-visit booking. Stable follow-up/report review, doctor-confirmed suitability/availability, possible in-person examination, separate home-visit fee. Prominent severe-symptom warning says seek emergency help without waiting for appointment/reply/payment. Source checked: MoHFW Telemedicine Practice Guidelines (official eSanjeevani PDF, emergency-care limitations); primary NHS emergency symptom guidance. No new payment/backend or availability promise. Pale readable card, 46px contact link, no new main tab. Requires visual preview review; not production.

Consultation notice verification: clinical-documents regression test passed after the HTML/CSS update; focused DOM checks passed for ₹500, Marathi, emergency warning, separate home fee, correct tel number and unique IDs. Local browser hero link reached the notice; screenshot inspected: dark text on pale card, clear fee and emergency warning. Screenshot saved as consultation-notice-review-20261026.jpg (QA only, not committed). Full suite remains the earlier 24-file pass; no claim of a new full-suite run. Notice and existing PR19 fixes remain NOT LIVE.

## Release continuation — 26 October 2026
Owner instructed proceeding without repeated suggestions after seeing the review screenshot. Treat as authorisation to finish and release this concrete PR19 correction batch, not a blanket claim that unrelated integrations work. Main remains 8fada37; remote review head d8be7fd. Latest exact-head preview dpl_GpJtSACh1k1kqAvhg3rCh1aXBXh6 READY. Entire 24-file suite re-run successfully after the consultation notice: 29.8 seconds. Next: finish remaining local document/card/QR checks, then merge PR19 and verify production.

Remaining overflow check completed: a diagnostic hook on the real PDF stamp received jsPDF's getNumberOfPages() = 2 for the 42-row synthetic prescription. All 42 rows and final signature/date/time retained in the DOM clone; no browser download completion claimed. Fitness visual check found an unnecessary second page in the ordinary synthetic case. Applied compact spacing to fitness/leave templates as well; original government forms remain unchanged. Rechecking this concrete defect before release.

Final local checks: ordinary synthetic fitness now one PDF page (clone 906px); consent one page (653px), with doctor and patient signature/date/time fields visible. Long 42-row Rx two pages with all rows retained. All three patient article action groups computed pale rgb(237,246,255) backgrounds/dark rgb(21,62,89) text, controls 46–51px. Payment methods initially closed; opening it leaves QR closed; tapping QR reveals a locally generated 180px data-image. Copy on insecure local preview correctly offered manual-copy fallback; secure production clipboard still to be checked. Actual UPI payment and native dialler/device printing are not asserted. All 24 tests passed again after the fitness/leave spacing correction. Ready to release this concrete batch under the latest owner instruction.

## Production verified — 26 October 2026
PR19 merge 1888c3a, deployment dpl_3vbXZvtF8HazQnNmiTUS29SF9yGT READY production. Live index.html, reading-print-fixes.css, clinical-documents.js returned HTTP200 and SHA256 matched current implementation. Browser verified notice/₹500 and English/Marathi severe-condition warning, all six article controls pale with dark text, payment/QR initially closed; secure Copy UPI ID reported success. Production screenshot live-consultation-20261026.jpg saved for handoff. Browser error sample concerned Chrome extension metadata; no app error identified in that sample, not a complete runtime monitoring scan. No purchase/payment, patient data entry or biometric enrolment performed. Master register updated with live ticks and remaining limits.

## Active follow-up — document close and A4 presentation
User reports no exit from prescription/lab/radiology after/before export, and half-size content on A4. Worktree document-exit-a4, branch fix/document-exit-a4, based on released main f945281. Added persistent per-document exit controls, keyboard exit and chooser without clearing inputs; generated clinical clones now use a full-page writing area with readable type and lower signoff. Need interaction/data-retention and actual PDF geometry/visual checks, ordinary/long page regression, then review/deploy. Current follow-up is not live. Preserve prior release checks; do not call one-page count alone visual proof.
