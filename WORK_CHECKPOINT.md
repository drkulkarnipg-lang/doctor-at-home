# Current resumable work checkpoint

Updated: 26 October 2026, India time.

## Resume here

Repository: `drkulkarnipg-lang/doctor-at-home`.
Working branch: `fix/reading-print-document-datetime`.
Durable implementation commit: `4725cf4cf700572166d4415445310fcd8638bfe5`.
Base production commit: `8fada37396585ec6f2b62a79b8e2c27ad2563d77`.
This batch is NOT released to production. Do not merge just to save progress.

## Completed and saved implementation

1. Pale article action controls with explicit dark text, border, focus and hover colours for heart/coconut-water/skin cards and their Read/Download/Share controls.
2. Payment methods collapsed by default; QR nested and collapsed. UPI app link and ID-copy controls added. Existing fee-linked, local QR generation retained; initial remote QR request removed.
3. Prescription DOB editor retained on screen but excluded from document clones and moved outside the demographic grid. Calculated age stays in the prescription.
4. Compact A4 document clone/print rules and isolated print root for ordinary prescriptions/pathology/radiology/referral/consent. Genuine long content is not truncated or forced into one page.
5. Doctor signature/name/date/time output across clinical documents; radiology identity/date/time fields; certificate issue/verification time; consent signatory fields; Form2 informant/Registrar date/time. Actual examination/death/signing events are not auto-invented. Government original PDFs remain unchanged.

## Verification completed

- All pre-existing 23 test files passed after the restored implementation.
- New `tests/clinical-documents.test.cjs` passed: metadata, India midnight boundary, retained event dates, fresh clone values, print isolation/cleanup, collapsed QR and UPI amount.
- Real html2pdf output was generated from synthetic local fixtures. Read-only PDF metadata inspection showed complete PDF trailers, A4 MediaBox and ONE page each for normal five-row prescription, pathology and radiology.
- Browser download completion events timed out; files were left as unconfirmed downloads by the cloud browser. These diagnostics do NOT establish successful final file handoff on the owner's device. No security control was bypassed, no pending file was delivered, and no actual patient data was used.

## Still unfinished — do not repeat completed steps

1. Verify the 42-row prescription genuinely expands to multiple pages; it was generated but its page count has not been confirmed.
2. Inspect final document appearance and the public article-action/QR screen states; record screenshots. Certificate/consent layout still needs visual checking.
3. Run the complete suite including the new test after any further changes.
4. Draft PR19 is saved: https://github.com/drkulkarnipg-lang/doctor-at-home/pull/19 . Verify/update its hosted preview after remaining checks. Production publication is not authorised merely by the saving request.

## Next action

Continue the remaining layout/overflow checks using the existing implementation. Recreate only temporary QA fixtures if needed. Save the result of each check here and synchronize the branch immediately.

## Workspace recovery note

Automated workspace cleanup removed the earlier uncommitted local batch. The repository was re-cloned and the known changes restored, then synchronized in commit 4725cf4. Future work must checkpoint remotely after each completed step. Never describe a new clone as restarting the project.

Checkpoint workflow and new test synchronized in remote commit 5d7eba9. PR19 was created as a draft; no production merge.
